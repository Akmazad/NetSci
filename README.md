# NetSci
 NetSci R package for Network Medicine Analysis


To install it please use:
```
install.packages("devtools")
# Load the devtools package.
library(devtools)
install_github("deisygysi/NetSci") 

```
**Note:** _Currently the above approach is failing due to the unavailability of 'wTO' package. Please download the archieved version of it from CRAN ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/wTO/)) and install it locally. For my case, attempting to install the 'wTO' dependency incurred manual installation of 'som' and 'HiClimR' packages, which are simply available from CRAN._
